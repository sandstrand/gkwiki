The create account form is displayed during onboarding and on the account page for anonymous users. The form is the starting point of the registration and/or authentication process and launches a number of other pages, all of which are declared as common forms, since their content is non-contextual.

Contexts:
* [[Account]]
* [[Onboarding: Create account]]
