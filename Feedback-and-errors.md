Feedback messages and error messages are displayed in different scenarios.

## Interaction errors and feedbacks 

The difference between the two is only aesthetic. They both consist of

* Error message
* Error description

Sometimes there will only be a message but other times a description or instruction follows to guide the user. The different possible messages are declared in this documentation for each context or form where the apply.

## Connectivity error
In the case loss of connectivity, the entire content of which ever page or meny the user is attempting to view is replaced by the error. So on a single page only the error is displayed. While the user might attempt to navigate to the 'find offers' or 'search offers' menu, where the content is locally cached/stored. An attempt to search can be made, but the result page would be empty with only the error.

* Error message: `No internet connection | `
* Error description / link:  `We were unable to fetch the information, check your internet connection and click to retry. | `
  * Action: Reload page.
