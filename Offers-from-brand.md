This isn't a page with a custom list as much as it is a regular search result page with a brand name as search string.

## Content
* [[Offer list]]  
  * Selection: The user could only end up in this view from another [[Offer]]. The list is a result of a search performed on the [brand.name]. Which means there could be offers from other brands in this list as well. See [[Search result]] for indexing.
  * Sort: [offer.publish_start] newest first.

* String on empty: `Sorry, couldn't find any more offers. | `   
Generally this list should never be empty since at least the offer from which the user got here would be listed.
