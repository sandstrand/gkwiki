The page is displayed after a Swish transaction is initiated and until the user has completed or cancelled the transaction in the Swish application.

When the transaction is initiated the swish app should be opened automatically but we provide a launch button as well.

On successful transaction the user is redirected back to the context.

On failure the user is redirected back to the [[Swish transaction form]] with the appropriate error message.
